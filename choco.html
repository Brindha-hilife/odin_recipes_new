    <h1>Healthy Hot Chocolate</h1>
    <P>Homemade hot chocolate is so easy to make, and it tastes way better than the store bought kind! There are just a few things to keep in mind when making this healthy hot chocolate.

        Skip the microwave. While you can go super simple and use the microwave here, it is important not to boil the milk.</P>
